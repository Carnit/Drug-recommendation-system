# üè• Drug Recommendation System

## üåü Project Showcase

**This project was showcased at Ideathon2k24 held at Chandigarh Group of Colleges**

## üìñ Overview

The **Drug Recommendation System** is an innovative machine learning-based solution designed to assist healthcare providers in making personalized medication recommendations to patients. This university project leverages advanced algorithms to analyze medicine descriptions, reasons for use, and other characteristics to suggest suitable alternative medications, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing the quality of healthcare delivery.

The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to find medicines with similar properties, enabling healthcare providers to offer alternatives when a specific medicine is unavailable, contraindicated, or not preferred by the patient.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Personalized Healthcare**: Provide tailored medication recommendations based on individual patient profiles
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Assist healthcare professionals in making informed treatment decisions
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize patient reviews and medical data to recommend optimal medications
- **Improved Patient Outcomes**: Enhance treatment effectiveness through intelligent drug selection

## üî¨ Key Features

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests drugs based on medication characteristics and descriptions
- **Text Analysis**: Processes medicine descriptions and reasons to understand medication purposes
- **Similarity Matching**: Identifies medicines with similar properties using cosine similarity

### üìä Core Technologies

#### 1. Cosine Similarity

- **Application**: Applied to find similar medicines based on their descriptions and reasons
- **Purpose**: Measures the similarity between medicine vectors in a multi-dimensional space
- **Benefit**: Enables accurate recommendation of similar medicines based on content features

#### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- **Data Processing**: Extracts meaningful information from medicine descriptions and reasons
- **Techniques**: Text cleaning, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization
- **Enhancement**: Improves recommendation accuracy by understanding medicine descriptions and uses

#### 3. Predictive Analytics

- **Health Disorder Prediction**: Predicts potential health conditions based on patient symptoms and history
- **Drug Efficacy Analysis**: Analyzes medication effectiveness based on user reviews and clinical data
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential drug interactions and contraindications

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a comprehensive approach combining:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Drug review datasets (Kaggle Repository)
   - Cleaning and normalizing medicine data
   - Text processing of medicine descriptions and reasons

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
   - Stopword removal for better text analysis
   - Stemming to normalize word variations
   - Cosine similarity calculation for recommendations

## üìà Benefits for Healthcare

### For Healthcare Providers

- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Data-driven insights for treatment planning
- **Time Efficiency**: Quick access to relevant medication options
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identification of potential drug interactions
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: Backed by patient reviews and clinical data

### For Patients

- **Personalized Treatment**: Medications tailored to individual needs
- **Improved Outcomes**: Higher likelihood of treatment success
- **Reduced Side Effects**: Better medication compatibility
- **Informed Choices**: Access to peer reviews and effectiveness data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## üìä Dataset Information

The system utilizes the <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saratchendra/medicine-recommendation/data> dataset

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.7+
pip (Python package installer)
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Carnit/Drug-recommendation-system.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd Drug-recommendation-system

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
# First run the medicine-recommend.ipynb
# clean the data
# Or run the data cleaning script to prepare your data
python data_cleaning.py

# then run teh below command 
jupyter notebook

# At last run the web application with Streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

### Important Note

The project relies on two large pickle files that aren't included in the repository due to size constraints:

- `similarity.pkl` (~3.76 GB): Contains similarity vectors for medicine recommendations
- `medicine_dict.pkl` (~2.53 GB): Contains the processed medicine dictionary

These files are generated by running the data processing scripts on the medicine dataset.
